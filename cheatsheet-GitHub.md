# GitHub Cheatsheet

## General Steps

1. Create repo on GitHub
2. Clone down to local machine
  a. In terminal: git clone `<http url>`
3. Write / edit stuff in VS Code
4. Commit code (ACP)
  a. Add:     `git status` to see what's changed
              `git add filename` or `git add .` to prep files for committing
  b. Commit:  `git commit -m "commit notes"` commits to local machine
  c. Push:    `git push origin branchName` pushes from local machine to remote branch

Do EVERYTHING in VS Code, not in GitHub
