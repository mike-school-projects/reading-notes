# Class 5 Notes

This is an important topic because React can get confusing and I need to be able to keep components, state, and props clearly identified.

## Reading Notes

React Docs - Thinking in React

1. What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?  Each component should only do 1 thing.  Make lots of components that are simple, one-task components.
2. What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?  Build a site that has no interactivity, no state.  Just use props to test it out.
3. Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?  Add state to make it interactive.
4. What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?  Is it passed via props?  Does it change?  Can you calculate it based on other state or props?
5. How can you identify where state needs to live?  Find the common parent

Higher-Order Functions

1. What is a “higher-order function”?  Fucntions that operate on other functions
2. Explore the greaterThan function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing? It is returning a function that compares any new number m to a fixed number n.
3. Explain how either map or reduce operates, with regards to higher-order functions.  map / reduce are functions that iterates through and performs another callback function.  So it's a function that operates on other functions.
