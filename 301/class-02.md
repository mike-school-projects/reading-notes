# Class 2 Notes

This is an important topic because React is widely used and I need to learn how it works.

## Reading Notes

React lifecycle

1. Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?  Render
2. What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?  Mounting of the constructor
3. Put the following things in the order that they happen: componentDidMount, render, constructor, componentWillUnmount, React Updates
constructor, render, React Updates, componentDidMount, componentWillUnmount
4. What does componentDidMount do? Allows us to interact with the DOM.

React State Vs Props

1. What types of things can you pass in the props?  Static items that don't change inside the component
2. What is the big difference between props and state?
Props - arguments that are passed into a component
State - handled inside a component
3. When do we re-render our application?  When the state changes
4. What are some examples of things that we could store in state?  Text, values, forms
