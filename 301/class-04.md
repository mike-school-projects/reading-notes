# Class 4 Notes

This is an important topic because forms are super useful for interactive sites and I need to learn it.

## Reading Notes

React Docs - Forms

1. What is a ‘Controlled Component’?  Where an HTML form input is controlled by React state
2. Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.  You want both to happen, where onChange sets the state, as well as on submit.
3. How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?  Use name field, and target event.target.name

The Conditional (Ternary) Operator Explained

1. Why would we use a ternary operator?  It can be used with React because it is a valid JS statement.
2. Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:

if(x===y){
  console.log(true);
} else {
  console.log(false);
}

x==y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false);
