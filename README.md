# My Reading Journal for 102

Hello world!  I am ***Mike Shen***.  I am currently a freelance consultant[^1].  In a previous life, I spent 6 years in the Navy as a Reactor Operator, and the last 18 years doing building automation systems.

Growth mindset is something I strongly belive in.  You don't need to be super smart.  You just need to apply yourself, learn, grow, and you can accomplish just about anything.  I am reminded to:
1. Always be learning
2. Earn it
3. Anything is possible

A quote that I just googled but sounds nice:
> “Continuous effort– not strength or intelligence – is the key to unlocking our potential.    --Winston Churchill
