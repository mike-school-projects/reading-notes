Growth mindset is something I strongly belive in.  You don't need to be super smart.  You just need to apply yourself, learn, grow, and you can accomplish just about anything.  I am reminded to:

1. Always be learning
2. Earn it
3. Anything is possible

A quote that I just googled but sounds nice:
> “Continuous effort– not strength or intelligence – is the key to unlocking our potential.    --Winston Churchill
