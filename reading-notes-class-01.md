# Class 01 reading notes

## Lecture notes:
Growth mindset is something I strongly belive in.  You don't need to be super smart.  You just need to apply yourself, learn, grow, and you can accomplish just about anything.  I am reminded to:
1. Always be learning
2. Earn it
3. Anything is possible

## Markdown Basic Syntax
Markdown is a simple way to add style and formatting to plain text documents using special symbols.
For instance, you can add a hashtag to indicate that the line is to be formatted as a heading.
This allows the user to create simple webpages quickly.
Special attention should be given to spaces: sometimes it likes it, sometimes it doesn't.
There's way too many syntax things to note: just read the [Markdown Guide](https://markdownguide.org/basic-syntax)
