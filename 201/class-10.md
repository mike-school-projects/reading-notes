# Class 10 notes

This is important because bugs are bad.  Need to learn how to get rid of them.

What Went Wrong? Troubleshooting JavaScript.

1. Name some key differences between a Syntax Error and a Logic Error.
Syntax error: dumb errors where the format of the code is wrong.
Logic error: code is working, but you made a mistake in the intent of the code.
2. List a few types of errors that you have encountered in past lab assignments and explain how you were able to correct them.
Common mistake is where I'm trying to grab a data value inside an array.  I added console.log to see what the data is first, then I can use it.
Another mistake is with loops, and not seeing how it executes.  I added a console.log('Loop ${i} starts here') so I know where the beginning of the loop is and which iteration I'm in.
3. How will this topic continue to influence your long term goals?  Goals is to make bug-free code, so yeah, this is important.

The JavaScript Debugger.

1. How would you describe the JavaScript Debugger tool and how it works to someone just starting out in software development?  It allows us to see Watch expressions as it occurs, and allows us to pause it at breakpoints.
2. Define what a breakpoint is.  You can add a point where the code stops so you can see what's going on.
3. What is the call stack?  Shows what code was executed to get to the current line.
