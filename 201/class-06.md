# Class 6 notes

This topic is important because objects are basic buildling blocks for code and it's necessary to understand what they are and how they work.  DOM is important because we want to make our webpage interactive.

JavaScript Object Basics

1. How would you describe an object to a non-technical friend you grew up with?  Object is a thing that has many attributes.  Take a soccer ball.  The object is the ball.  Shape is a sphere.  Color is white.  
2. What are some advantages to creating object literals?  It's a good way to store and associate data with each other.
3. How do objects differ from arrays?  Arrays are collections of data.  Objects have properties, and you can create many objects with similar attributes.
4. Give an example for when you would need to use bracket notation to access an objectâ€™s property instead of dot notation.  If you are accessing a property via a variable, then you woul dneed to use bracket notatoin.
5. Evaluate the code below. What does the term this refer to and what is the advantage to using this?  THIS refers to the current object.  So if you call dog.humanAge(), it returns Spot is 14 in human years.  It allows you to to create multiple objects (with different names), but still have the console.log output correctly.

Introduction To The DOM

1. What is the DOM?  Programming interface for web documents.  
2. Briefly describe the relationship between the DOM and JavaScript.  JS is the programming language that accesses a webpage via DOM.  DOM is like an API.
