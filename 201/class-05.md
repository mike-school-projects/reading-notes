# Class 5 notes

This is important because web pages would be pretty lame without images and color.  Pretty pages get more hits.

HTML Media
Using Images In HTML. Read Common Image Types and Choosing Image Formats.

1. What is a real world use case for the alt attribute being used in a website?  For the visually impaired using a screen reader - they would have a description for what the picture is supposed to be.
2. How can you improve accessibility of images in an HTML document?  Add captions.
3. Provide an example of when the figure element would be useful in an HTML document.  Built-in element that contains image and caption: way easier than building your own.  And it's a semantic element as well.
4. Describe the difference between a gif image and an svg image, pretend you are explaining to an elder in your community.  GIF is your basic image.  SVG is a scalable image that looks good when blown up or shrunk down.
5. What image type would you use to display a screenshot on your website and why?  PNG because it is more precise.

Learn CSS
Using Color in CSS. Styling HTML Text Elements

1. Describe the difference between foreground and background colors of an HTML element, pretend you are talking to someone with no technical knowledge.  Foreground is the content, background is everything else behind it.
2. Your friend asks you to give his colorless blog website a touch up. How would you use color to give his blog some character?  If I liked the guy, I would use a color picker tool to subtle add colors that matched.  If I didn't, bright green and red all over.
3. What should you consider when choosing fonts for an HTML document?  Use a web safe font so it works on all browers.
4. What do font-size, font-weight, and font-style do to HTML text elements? Changes the size, thickness, and italics of the text
5. Describe two ways you could add spacing around the characters displayed in an h1 element. Use letter-space and word-spacing.
