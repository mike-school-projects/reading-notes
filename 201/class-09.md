Introduction To Events.

1. How would you describe events to a non-technical friend?  Something that occurs when you interact with a webpage, like click a button.
2. When using the addEventListener() method, what 2 arguments will you need to provide?  Name of the event, and the function to handle the event.
3. Describe the event object. Why is the target within the event object useful? It allows us to take action of the element where the event occured on.
4. What is the difference between event bubbling and event capturing?  Bubbling is referencing how an event may happen on multiple nested items, from innermost to outer.  Event capturing reverses the order from least nested to most nested.
