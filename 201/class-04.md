Miscellaneous
6 Reasons for Pair Programming

1. Pick 2 benefits to pair programming and reflect on how these benefits could help you on your coding journey.  Engaged collaboration and learning from others is a big ones for me.  This helps to widen my perspective on how things can/should be done so I can be a better programmer.
