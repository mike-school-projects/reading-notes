# Class 14a notes - Psychological Safety

This is important because we are about to start on our project teams and hopefully it won't devolve into a lord of the flies situation.

1. What are three key factors that contribute to psychologically safe teams?  Equality in turn-taking conversation.  Empathy.  Safe space to talk.
2. Evaluate, with details, a previous professional setting (or team) you were in with regards to psychological safety.  In one of my previous jobs, the team I was on was comprised of all high-performing individuals, but there was one senior engineer that dominated the conversation and made it hard for others to contribute meaningfully.

3. What impact do teams that operate with a high degree of psychological safety have on their company and the team members?  It makes teams more productive, more creative, and just overall better.
