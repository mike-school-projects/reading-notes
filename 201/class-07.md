# Class 7 notes

This is important because creating objects one by one sucks.  We want to use constructors to be able to do it rapidly and with less chance of typographical mistakes.  It's the far bettter way to do things.

Reading
Domain Modeling

1. Explain why we need domain modeling.  It is a way to organize information and data effectively.  It's helps to visualize a problem and can help to understand what you need to do to address the problem.

HTML Table Basics

1. Why should tables not be used for page layouts?  Bad for accessibility, bad for responsiveness, and more complex than just using CSS.
2. List and describe 3 different semantic HTML elements used in an HTML `<table>`.  
  a. `<th>` table header
  b. `<col>` column
  c. `<tr>` table row

Introducing Constructors

1. What is a constructor and what are some advantages to using it?  It's essentially a special function call that can create multiple object literals.  Makes it much easier and faster to create objects.

2. How does the term this differ when used in an object literal versus when used in a constructor?  In an object, this refers to the object.  But in a constructor, it refers to the object created by the constructor.

Object Prototypes Using A Constructor

1. Explain prototypes and inheritance via an analogy from your previous work experience.  It's like find and replace all.  You make one change and it applies to all other instances.
