# Class Notes

This is an important topic because the concept of Big O is important to writing efficient and scalable code so it's not bloated.  Also, infinite loops are bad, so need to not do that.

1. What is 1 of the more important things you should consider when deciding which data structure is best suited to solve a particular problem?  Need to think about what the data needs to do and how those operations work.  That will impact the speed and efficiency of the solution.

2. How can we ensure that weâ€™ll avoid an infinite recursive call stack?  Need to consider both the base case and the recursive case.  Recursive case will kick us out of the loop.
