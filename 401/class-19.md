This is an important topic because...

1. How can you use regular expressions in Python to search for specific patterns in a string, and what is the primary library to work with them?

re is the main library to use

2. What is the purpose of the shutil library in Python, and provide an example of a common use case for file or directory management with this library?

shutil is a library for high-level file operations.  Lots of use cases, including copying files, copying file metadata, working with directories, finding files.

3. Explain one automation idea from the assigned material and describe how it can be implemented using Pythonâ€™s regular expressions and shutil libraries.
