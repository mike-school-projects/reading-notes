# Class Notes

This is an important topic because Django is another framework that is widely used in conjunction with python.

1. What are the key components of the Django framework, and how do they contribute to building a web application?
- data models for API, SQL usage
- paths for URLs
- Templates for creating html using variables
- Internationalization for translating to different languages

2. Explain the role of Djangoâ€™s MTV (Model-View-Template) architecture and how it handles a typical web request-response cycle.
- Model has data structure
- View is the user interface
- Template is the html file that incorporates the view and python code


Path maps from the URL to a view

Template renders the View, incorporating data from the Model

3. What is the purpose of Tailwind CSS, and how does it differ from Bootstrap CSS?
