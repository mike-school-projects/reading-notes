# Class Notes

This is an important topic because having a growth mindset is key to being successful in life.

Emotional Intelligence:

Not a whole lot of new insights, but reaffirms what I've seen in the past.  I believe I am pretty well-rounded in terms of emotional intelligence.  My past experience as a manager has helped me to develop those skills.  I think I can see where other people are coming from, and I can adjust accordingly.

Bias assessment:

Despite my score of 90, I think that I'm good in the area of bias.  I think the questions can be interpreted in ways to cause a 'bad' score.  For example: Q2 is "I don't think I've ever really demonstrated a bias".  I strongly agree with this, but this is a 'bad' score, but I think this is a good thing.

In practice, I had been a manager for about 10 years at my former employer.  We hired an outside company to assess management on bias, inclusivity, etc.  I did pretty good there, so I think I'm good.  But of course, my opinion may be biased...
