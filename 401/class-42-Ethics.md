# Class Notes

This is an important topic because being unethical is bad.

## Code of Ethics:

The ACM Code of Ethics and Professional Conduct provides guidelines for how people working with computers and technology should behave. It tells them to do things that help society, not harm others, and respect people's rights. The code says that they should be honest and good at their job, and help other people in their profession. It also tells them to follow the code and learn about ethical issues. By following the code, people who work with computers can make good choices, solve ethical problems, and use technology in a way that helps everyone.  I agree with these guidelines.  

## Project Dragonfly: Google's censored search engine

The project created a censored search engine for the Chinese market.  This raised a lot of moral and ethical issues in that there is a conflict between Google's own core values and what it was doing.  Developing a search engine that complied with China's censorship policies would restrict access to dissenting information and potentially facilitate government surveillance. In the end, Google shut down the program.  I agree that the article that there were valid concerns.  What stuck out was that Google's employees played a key part in getting it shut down.

## Ethical dilemma of self driving cars

One key ethic problem is how to decide which lives are more important to save.  An example given was choosing between running over a child versus swerving into oncoming traffic.  Guidelines say to prioritize life evenly, without regard to age, gender, race, etc.  This also differs from what humans may normally do in similar situations.  Humans will normally prioritize their own lives.  I agree with the article with the questions it raised.  I agree that guidelines are necessary.  What stuck out to me is how much unknowns there still are.  Guidelines are nice, but they can't possibly cover ever situation.  And as it applies to tech, how does a programming account for all of the other potential factors?  

## Microsoft AI Principles

Microsoft lays out 6 guiding princples: fairness, reliability, privacy and security, inclusiveness, transparancy, and accountability.  They emphasize the importance of fairness, ensuring that AI systems don't discriminate or perpetuate biases. Reliability and safety are prioritized to build trustworthy AI systems that operate predictably and without unintended consequences. Privacy and security measures are implemented to protect personal data. Inclusiveness is promoted by making AI accessible and beneficial to all individuals. Transparency is valued, with a focus on clear explanations of AI system behavior. Finally, accountability is emphasized to take responsibility for the impact of AI technologies and comply with ethical standards.  I agree with these principles, but they are a little vague.  I think issues that might need to be addressed in more detail are the potential socio-economic impacts and environmental impacts.
