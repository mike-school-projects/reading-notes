# Class Notes

This is an important topic because this is the next step in putting it all together with a front and back end.

1. In the context of ES6 Syntax and Feature Overview, what are three key features introduced in ES6 that improve upon the previous version of JavaScript, and briefly explain their benefits?

Added let variable declarations which allows for block-scoped variables

Arrow functions - makes it faster to code simple anonymous functions

Added template literals - which allows for easier output of string and variable combinations


2. After reading “Tailwind in 15 minutes,” can you describe the purpose of utility classes in Tailwind CSS and provide an example of how to use them to style an HTML element?

This video is unavailable to watch.  But chatGPT says this: 

Utility classes in Tailwind CSS are pre-defined classes that provide a set of styles for commonly used CSS properties. These classes are designed to be highly composable and flexible, allowing developers to quickly and easily apply styling to their HTML elements without having to write custom CSS code. The purpose of utility classes is to make it easier to create a consistent and visually appealing design system, while also reducing the amount of CSS code that needs to be written.

3. Based on “Why to use Next.js,” explain the main advantages of using Next.js for web development, and provide a brief comparison between traditional client-side rendering and Next.js’s server-side rendering approach.

Next.js can do server-side render where HTML pages are created on the server, where react can only do client side.

Next.js has better performance.

With traditional client-side rendering, the front-end renders the html using Javascript.  This is slow because all the JS has to load and execute before the page is created.

With Next.js, the page is generated on the server side which does not require client-side Javascript, so the page does not have to wait for JS to load and so performance is improved.
