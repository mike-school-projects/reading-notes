# Class Notes

This is an important topic because understanding Django structure is key to actually using Django.

1. Explain the purpose and basic structure of Django models. How do they help in creating and managing database schema in a Django application?

Models store the data structure with model classes.

Model class has fields, metadata, and methods.

Fields are like the schema.

Metadata can be used to control the order of data returned.

Methods can be used to create / read records.

2. Describe the primary features and functionality of the Django Admin interface. How can it be customized to suit the specific needs of a project?

Admin interface can be used to manage the data.

Admin interface has user access controls.

After loggin in, user can add, view, change, and delete records.

Can be configured with custom views to view the records in specific ways.

3. Briefly outline the key components and workflow of a Django application, as discussed in the Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Django. How do these components interact with each other to create a functional web application?

There's a project, and under the project there can be multiple apps.

Project's urls.py points to paths or to other app urls.py files.

App urls.py points to paths.  Paths include the browser url path, a name, and a View to use.

View points to a html file.  Also can include data that can be pulled into the html file.

HTML file can use a template (or base) html file for reusable code.  Can also include Django code snippets to pull in dynamic data.
