# Reading Notes

This is an important topic because the concept of O notation is important for understanding how to make efficient code.

## Pain and Suffering

401 is going to be tough.  Suck it up.

Need to keep up with all the readings and not fall behind.

Need to seek out TA help if I get stuck.

Need to keep end goal in mind.

## Beginners Guide to Big O

Big O describes execution time or space required by an algorithm as a function of size.
O(1) is a constant - same execution time regardless of input size.
O(N) - linear.  Example: for loop through array
O(N^2) - proprotional to square.  Example: nested loops
O(2^N) - exponential.  Example: add items in growing array
O(log N) - logarithmic.  Example: binary search

## Names and Values in Python

Assignment nevers copies data
Anything on left side of assignment is a REFERENCE
To avoid problem of aliasing, don't mutate.  Create a new object and assign it.
