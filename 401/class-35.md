# Class Notes

This is an important topic because...

## Graph vocabulary:
Acyclic graph - directed graph without cycles

Complete graph - graph when all nodes are connected to all other nodes

Connected graph - graph that has all of vertices/nodes have at least one edge

Cycle - when a node can be traversed through and potentially end up back at itself

Cyclic graph - graph that has cycles

Degree - The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to that vertex.

Directed Graph - graph where every edge is directed (also called a Digraph)

Disconnected graph - graph where some vertices may not have edges

Edge - An edge is a connection between two nodes.

Neighbor - The neighbors of a node are its adjacent nodes, i.e., are connected via an edge.

Undirected Graph - graph where each edge is undirected or bi-directional.

Vertex - A vertex, also called a “node”, is a data object that can have zero or more adjacent vertices.
