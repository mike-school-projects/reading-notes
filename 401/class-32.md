# Class Notes

This is an important topic because working with data is super important in the industry and we need to know databases and APIs.


1. What are the key components and purpose of Django Rest Framework (DRF) permissions, and how do they help in securing an API?

Permission classes.  Can be used to control access to views.

Object level permissions.  Can be used to control access to objects / models.

Both of these help to control what the user sees and what the user can modify.

2. In SQL, what is the purpose of the SELECT statement, and how would you use it to retrieve all columns from a table called ‘employees’?

SELECT retrieves records from a table based on certain criteria.

SELECT * from employees.

* means to retrieve all.

from employees means to retrieve from the database table.

3. Can you explain the role of DRF Generic Views and provide examples of their usage in building a RESTful API?

Generic views are pre-built templates that are used to build API views.  It's a down and dirty way to get an API up and running, useful for testing as well.
