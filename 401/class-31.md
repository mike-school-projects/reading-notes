# Class Notes

This is an important topic because Docker and DRF are both commonly used components that we need to learn.

1. What are the key components of a Docker container, and how do they help streamline the development and deployment of applications?

Image: snapshot of what a project contains.

Container: running an instance of the image.

Dockerfile: install instructions, similar to requirements.txt

docker-compose.yml: runs the files in the container

2. Describe the primary steps involved in building a library website using Django, including essential components like models, views, and templates.

- Create repo, clone, install django
- Create project
- Install dependencies (Tailwind, compressor, flowbite, etc)
- Freeze requirements
- Create custom users account
- Create app for library website
- Create Model (i.e. schema) for holding books
- Create Templates (i.e. html files) for displaying books
- Create Views that connect model to templates
- Create urls that setup the routes to get to the templates

3. Can you explain the primary differences between Django and Django REST framework?

Django is a web framework.  It's used for building web applications that needs a lot of database information.

Django REST Framework is for building web APIs.  It's something that builds upon Django.  It provides a way to interacte with the data using REST interface.
