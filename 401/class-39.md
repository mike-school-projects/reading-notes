# Class Notes

This is an important topic because props are hard to deal with and React Context can help fix thx.

1. What is React Context, and how does it help in managing state and data sharing in a React application?

React Context allows for sharing state between components.

It helps by sharing state similar to using global variables, and it avoids using props and having to pass state down multiple levels via props.

2. Explain the useContext Hook and how it can be used to access data from a React Context within a functional component.

It the parent, a data is 'sent' to context.

In the child, useContext can be used to pull the data in.

React.useContext(UserContext)

3. Describe the purpose of Next.js, and provide an example from the Vercel Next.js Examples reading on how it can be used to build a scalable web application.

The purpose of Next.js is to make creating web applications fast.

Next.js includes server-side rendering and static site generation which should improve page load speed.

It also includes API routes to allow for combined front and back ends into a single project.

One example is api-routes-cors, which allows you to create API endpoints with CORS headers.
