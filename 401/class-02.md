# Class Notes

This is an important topic because testing helps to prevent bugs which are bad

## In Tests We Trust - TDD with Python

TDD = Test-Driven Development -> think and write tests first
Test names are important - be descriptive with expectation and test
File name should be test_module_name.py

## If name equals main

__name__ is a special variable.  It is set to __main__ if the file is run directly

If not run directly, it will be set to the module's name.

## Recursion

Recursion is a function that calls itself.
Separate into base case and recursive case.
Base case: when to stop recursion
Recursive case: repetitive function
Be careful of infinite loops / stack overflow
Compared to iterative loops, recursion uses more space and has more time requirements.  Recursion tends to be cleaner and simpler code.
