# Hash Tables

Purpose is to take in an input and mix up the storage of it, most likely for security purposes.

Key components to a hash table:
1. Value: this is the output data
2. Hash function: determines where to put the data
3. Key: the location of the Value
4. Storage: where to store the values
5. Table operations: methods to set and retrieve data

It's basically a dictionary with key/value pair, with an added function to jumble things up.

Pros:
O(1) time complexity, since it acts like a dictionary.

Cons:
Could result in collisions, where to values hash to the same key.

Examples:
- Python dictionaries
- JavaScript objects
