# Class Notes

This is an important topic because deploying a project is a pretty important thing if you want anyone to see or use your website.

1. Explain the concept of dynamic routes in Next.js and how they differ from static routes.

Static routes have one url that go to one page.

Dynamic routes have parameters that may change which lead to different page displays.  This is what we use for the detail pages for our backend API labs.

2. Describe the process of deploying a Next.js application. What are the key steps involved, and what are some deployment platforms you can use?

Build the application.

Link the repo to vercel.  Other platforms include Heroku, Netlify, and Firebase.

Configure the project.

Deploy.

3. How does Next.js handle static file serving? Discuss the default folder structure for storing static assets and explain how to reference them in a Next.js application.

Resources are in the public folder.  This makes it accessible from the web browser directly, instead of having to go to the server.

Typical folder structure includes a /public folder, /public/images, and /public/css folders.

You can reference them by using a href to the /public folder.
