# Class Notes

This is an important topic because these new libraries should help us to visualize data easier and faster.

1. What are the key differences between Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Bokeh libraries in terms of their features and use cases? Provide an example of a specific visualization that is more suitable for each library.

Matplotlib - used for 2D graphics.  Good for simple plots like a simple scatter plot.

Seaborn - is basically an extension of Matplotlib, with default settings already set for certain chart types.  Example use case: heat map.

Bokeh - good for interactive charts.  Example use case: anything that I want to hover and interact with the data.

2. In the Seaborn library, what are the main functions to create relational, categorical, and distribution plots? Briefly explain the purpose of each type of plot and provide an example use case.

relplot() for relational.  Example: QB salary vs Total yards per game scatter plot.

catplot() for categorical. Example: Total yards per game by month of year

displot() for distribution.  Example: Rush yards and pass yards by month of year in a stacked bar chart.

3. Discuss the role of the Seaborn Cheat Sheet in a Python developerâ€™s workflow. What are some key sections or elements featured in the cheat sheet that can help a developer quickly reference Seaborn functionalities?

Cheat sheet has a great flow: it takes you through the steps in an orderly fashion from importing in data to plotting to customizing.

Section 3 with the various types of plots is probably the most useful, showing the syntax needed for lots of standard plots.
