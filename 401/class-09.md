# Class Notes

This is an important topic because dealing with statistics can be a large part of any job these days, so knowning how to use the statistics module is important.  Also, we don't want to be unethical and steal code.

1. What is the purpose of dunder methods in Python? Provide an example of a commonly used dunder method.

Built-in methods for classes.  Not directly invoked, but invoked by the class.

A commonly used one is __name__ which is a variable that stores the name of the module that calls it.
Used as a 'main gate' to run code if the module is called directly.

2. In the video “AI Guru makes $238,800 with misleading paid course,” what was the main ethical issue raised concerning the use of developers’ work, and how might this have been avoided?

He lied about number of students accepted.

Added a refund policy that was already expired.

Stole github code for his udacity course with attribution.  Didn't fork, so original author couldn't see that he took code.

3. Describe the Python statistics module and give an example of a function within the module that can be used to perform a common statistical operation.

The module 'statistics' has some commonly used calculations for statistics including mean, median, mode, stdev, etc.

For example, median([1,3,5,7,9]) would return 5.
