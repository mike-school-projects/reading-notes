## Choosing a Text Editor
Text editors can make coding easier.  There are many out there, all with their own pros and cons.
Some things to look for in a text editor:
- Code completion
- Syntax highlighting
- Themes
- Extensions

There are text editors that come pre-installed on your computer, but these have NO extra features.

Integrated Development Environments (IDE) take it one step further by adding file manager, compiler, and debugger in one package.

## The Command Line
This recaps the commands discussed in the lecture notes.
Linux is extension-less: the .xxx that you see in Windows does not matter to Linux
To handle special characters, either use quotes or escape character, which is a backslash (\)
Files that begin with a period are automatically hidden files.
ls -a shows all files, including hidden files.
